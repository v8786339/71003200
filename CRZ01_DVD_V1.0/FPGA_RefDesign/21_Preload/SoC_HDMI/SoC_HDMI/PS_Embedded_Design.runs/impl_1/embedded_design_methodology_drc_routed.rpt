2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock ps_subsys_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on dip_switches[0] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on dip_switches[1] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on dip_switches[2] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on dip_switches[3] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on iic_scl relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on iic_sda relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on pl_uart_rxd relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on push_buttons[0] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#9 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on push_buttons[1] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#10 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on push_buttons[2] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#11 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[0] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#12 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[1] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#13 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[2] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#14 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[3] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#15 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on pl_uart_txd relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock ps_subsys_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin ps_subsys_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>
