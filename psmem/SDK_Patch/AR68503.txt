2016.4 - SDK - GDB/XMD debug will not work for Zynq designs created using Vivado 2016.4

Description

GDB/XMD debug will not work for the Zynq designs created using Vivado 2016.4.

This is due to the "-force" option added to the mwr command in the ps7_init.tcl file for new 2016.4 Vivado based designs.

This "-force" option is not supported for the mwr command in XMD. As a result, the GDB Debug flow is not working for Zynq designs.

How can I resolve this issue?
Solution

Replace the xmdterm.tcl file in your SDK installation with the attached xmdterm.tcl.

The xmdterm.tcl file can be found in the following location in the SDK install:

<SDK_installation_directory>/SDK/2016.4/scripts/xmd/xmdterm.tcl

Note:

Make sure to delete the old xmdterm.tcl before copying the attached Tcl file.

Re-open the SDK workspace to have the changes applied.
